Describe the operations over columns and rows as an integer programming problem.
For example,

0+0
-+-
0+0

becomes 

r1 + c1 = 0
r1 + c2 > 0
r1 + c3 = 0
r2 + c1 < 0
r2 + c2 > 0
r2 + c3 < 0
r3 + c1 = 0
r3 + c2 > 0
r3 + c3 = 0

which in turn becomes a set of relations between rows and columns.

r1 = -c1
r1 > -c2
r1 = -c3
r2 < -c1
r2 > -c2
r2 < -c3
r3 = -c1
r3 > -c2
r3 = -c3

If there is a cycle, the system is inconsistent. Otherwise you can find an ordering of the variables

r1 = -c1 = -c3 = r3 > r2 > -c2

by modelling the variables and the inequalities as a graph and running toposort over it.

There is always a solution that assigns 0 to at least one row or column, so you should only consider at most 2*n assignments. Iterate over all and output the minimum.	

Overall complexity is O(n^2 * T) for T test cases.
